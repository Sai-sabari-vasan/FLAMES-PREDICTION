# FLAMES-PREDICTION
This repository contains a Python implementation of the FLAMES game as a mini-project. I also tested the game using real-world data by analyzing a dataset of Hollywood marriages. The analysis demonstrates how FLAMES predictions compare with actual data trends. Dataset Source: Hollywood Marriages Lasting Over 50 Years  (TheDevastator, Kaggle) .
